# SellMe
Sell Me was a mobile game in prototype stage, where the players could go on adventures and generate loot to sell in their merchant shop.
The loot would be generated by walking while an adventure was active(like Pokemon GO or other location based games).
The player could then arrange the loot in showcases. When the player was ready they can open their shop.
Upon opening their shop AI customers become interested in items based on their set traits(rich, poor, swords, etc...).
The game was intended to be more like an endless runner where the player needed to avoid going bankrupt rather than reaching a specific goal.

Google Play integration and Android things were done with Daniel Beer
